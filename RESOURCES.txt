There a many resources on SQL, many of them excellent.  Here are some I find particularly helpful:


BOOKS

SQL: Visual QuickStart Guide (3rd Edition)
------------------------------------------
Chris Fehily
2008

-   Does an unusually good job of explaining fundamental principles and
    solutions to particular problems.  EXCELLENT.


MySQL (5th Edition) (Developer's Library)
-----------------------------------------
Paul DuBois
2013

-   (I'm familiar with the 4th edition.)
-   This is a developer and db administrator resource.  It has some discussion
    of query syntax, but the focus is on integrating MySQL with other
    programming tools and system administration of MySQL.
-   The chief values for those starting with MySQL are:
    -   A different account of the syntax.  I find that sometimes reading two
        different (but good) explanations helps me understand better.
    -   A discussion of MySQL permissions and connections.  New users do
        encounter this stuff and sometimes an explanation is helpful.
    -   Some discussion of MySQL's tools for user-defined functions, stored
        procedures and variables.
    -   An appendix detailing the MySQL syntax, and the available functions.
        All of this is available online, but I sometimes find it helpful to
        browse this stuff in hardcopy.  It can be particularly helpful to get
        oriented to the sort of functions that are available.
-   Note that most of these advantages are specific to the MySQL
    implementation.  



WEBSITES

-   Online documentation for whatever implementation you are using.
-   stackoverflow.com is a great resource for programming questions.
-   dba.stackexchange.com is a stackoverflow-style Q&A site dedicated to
    databases.  There are a lot of query syntax questions and answers.
-   Google.
