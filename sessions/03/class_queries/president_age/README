These are the queries for two analytic flows to list of longest lived president
of each state. 

The numbered queries comprises the VIEW approach.  They must be run in numeric
order, as each depends on the VIEW created in the prior queries.

The not-numbered query shows the generation of the same result by subquery,
without use of VIEW statements.
