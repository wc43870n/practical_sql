SUBQUERIES
----------
Filtering and Calculating by Subquery
-------------------------------------
These exercises require a table with president's age.  Please create such at
table.  (Note that the queries shown in class are included in the class_queries/
subdirectory.)

NB: None of these require a correlated subquery.

1.  Write a query returning a list of presidents who lived longer than the
    average for the data set.

2.  Write a query returning the age of the third longest living president.

3.  Write a query returning the number of presidents from the state with the
    greatest number of presidents.  (NB: Pass a column alias out of the
    subquery to the aggregating function of the calling query.)

4.  Write a query returning the name of the state with the largest number of
    presidents.  (NB: This may require two subqueries, one in FROM, another in
    WHERE.)

5.  Write a query returning a list of presidents, from the state with the
    largest number of presidents, who lived longer than the average life span
    of all presidents.

6.  Write a query returning, from table score, for event #1
    -   the event_id, student_id, score and average score for the event
    -   for those student who scored above average

    NB: You do NOT need a correlated subquery here.

7.  From president, for those states that have more than one president of the
    same last name, return the state, the duplicated last name, and the number
    of presidents of with that last name.
