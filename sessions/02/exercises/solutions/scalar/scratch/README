These two queries provide one path to reformatting the date data from Google
finance for load to a SQL table.

1   Run the query 'create_view.date_clean.sql'.

        This creates a 'VIEW', essentially a stored query that behaves like a
        table.  It is referred to in other queries as if it were a table.
        Unlike tables, its values are not stored, but calculated at the moment
        when the VIEW is called on.

        The query in this VIEW decomposes the Google Finance date strings into
        components supporting transformation to yyyy-mm-dd format.

2   Run reformat_date.sql.  This query shows how to use the values retrieved by
    the date_clean VIEW to construct the date strings in the format needed for 
    load to a SQL database.
